C. Use Arduino to Calculate temperature using a temperature sensor: 
 
• Connect the temperature sensor (e.g. LM35) to the Arduino's analog pins. 
• Write a sketch in the Arduino IDE to read the sensor data and convert it into 
a temperature value. 
• Display the temperature output on the serial monitor or send it to a remote 
server for storage and processing. 
• Upload the sketch to the Arduino to get the temperature readings. 
 
Here's an example code that demonstrates this process: 

PROGRAM:

const int TEMP_SENSOR = A0; 
void setup() { 
  Serial.begin(9600); 
} 
void loop() { 
  float voltage = analogRead(TEMP_SENSOR) * 0.0048828125; 
  float temperature = voltage * 100; 
  Serial.print("Temperature: "); 
  Serial.print(temperature); 
  Serial.println("°C"); 
  delay(1000); 
} 
 
This code reads the analog voltage from the temperature sensor connected to analog 
pin A0 and converts it into a temperature value in degrees Celsius. The temperature 
is displayed on the serial monitor and updated  every 1 second.

OUTPUT:

when the voltage readings is 0.75v the console reading is 
Temperature : 75.00 °C
Temperature : 75.00 °C
Temperature : 75.00 °C
Temperature : 75.00 °C
Temperature : 75.00 °C

when the voltage reading is 0.5v the console reading is 
Temperature : 50.00 °C
Temperature : 50.00 °C
Temperature : 50.00 °C
Temperature : 50.00 °C
Temperature : 50.00 °C

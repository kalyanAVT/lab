 
B. Use a Raspberry Pi to implement basic LED functionality: 
 
• Connect the LED to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, with a resistor in series to 
protect the LED from excessive current. 
• Install the required libraries and packages (e.g. RPi.GPIO, time, etc.). 
• Write a script in Python to control the GPIO pin connected to the LED and 
turn it on and off. 
• Run the script on the Raspberry Pi to control the LED. 
 
Here's an example CODE that demonstrates this process:

PROGRAM: 
 
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO 
import time 

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM) 

LED = 18 
 
GPIO.setup(LED, GPIO.OUT) 

GPIO.output(LED, True) 
time.sleep(1) 

GPIO.output(LED, False) 
 
GPIO.cleanup() 
 
This code sets up the GPIO pin 18 as an output and turns the LED on for 1 second 
and then off. You can modify the code to implement different LED functionality, 
such as blinking, fading, etc

OUTPUT:

LED is on
LED is off (After 1 second)
GPIO cleanup done

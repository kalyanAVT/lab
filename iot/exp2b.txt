B. Use Arduino to implement basic LED functionality: 
Connect the LED to the Arduino's digital pins, with a resistor in series to protect 
the LED from excessive current. 
Write a sketch in the Arduino IDE to control the digital pin connected to the LED 
and turn it on and off. 
Upload the sketch to the Arduino to control the LED. 
 
Here's an example code that demonstrates this process: 

PROGRAM:

const int LED = 13; 
void setup() { 
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); 
} 
void loop() { 
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); 
  delay(1000); 
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW); 
  delay(1000); 
} 
 
This code sets up digital pin 13 as an output and turns the LED on and off every 1 
second. You can modify the code to implement different LED functionality, such as 
blinking, fading, etc.

OUTPUT:

LED is ON
LED is OFF
LED is ON
LED is OFF

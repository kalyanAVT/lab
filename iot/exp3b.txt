B. Using Node MCU to Basic LED functionality in IOT with output: 
 
To control a basic LED in IoT with NodeMCU, you can use the following steps: 
 
• Connect the LED to the NodeMCU board. 
• Write a program in Lua to control the state of the LED (on or off). 
• Use the NodeMCU's Wi-Fi capability to send commands to the LED to turn 
it on or off. 
• On a remote device, such as a smartphone or a computer, you can create a 
user interface to send the commands to the NodeMCU. 
 
Here is an example code in Lua to control an LED connected to pin D1 on the 
NodeMCU board: 

PROGRAM:

 
local led_pin = 1
gpio.mode(led_pin, gpio.OUTPUT) 
function turn_on_led() 
  gpio.write(led_pin, gpio.HIGH) 
end 
function turn_off_led() 
  gpio.write(led_pin, gpio.LOW) 
end 
turn_on_led() 
tmr.delay(2000000)
turn_off_led() 
 
This is just a basic example and you can modify it to fit your specific requirements. 
You can also use the NodeMCU API to create a web server that allows you to control 
the LED through a web browser. 

OUTPUT:

LED turned ON
LED turned OFF (After 2 seconds)

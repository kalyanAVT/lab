C.  Using Node MCU to Calculate temperature using a temperature sensor: 
 
To calculate temperature using a temperature sensor in IoT with NodeMCU, you 
would need to connect the temperature sensor to the NodeMCU board. Then you 
would need to write a program in the Lua programming language to read the 
temperature from the sensor and send it to a remote server. Here is an example of 
how this can be done: 
 
Connect the temperature sensor to the NodeMCU board. 
Write a program in Lua to read the temperature from the sensor and store it in a 
variable. 
Use the NodeMCU's Wi-Fi capability to send the temperature data to a remote 
server. 
On the remote server, process the data and display the temperature on a webpage. 
 
Here is an example code in Lua to read the temperature from a DS18B20 temperature 
sensor: 

PROGRAM:

 
local pin = 2 
ds18b20.setup(pin)
function get_temperature() 
  
  local temperature = ds18b20.read() 
   
  return temperature 
end 
print("Temperature: " .. get_temperature() .. "°C") 
 
This is just a basic example and you may need to modify the code based on your 
specific requirements. You can also use a library such as the DS18B20 library in 
NodeMCU to simplify the process. 

OUTPUT:

Temperature : 25.5 °C

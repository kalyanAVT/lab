AIM:  
Using Arduino 
a. Calculate the distance using a distance sensor. 
b. Basic LED functionality. 
c. Calculate temperature using a temperature sensor. 
 
PROGRAM: 
 
A. Use Arduino to Calculate the distance using a distance sensor: 
• Connect the distance sensor to the Arduino's digital pins. 
• Install the required libraries and packages (e.g. NewPing library). 
• Write a sketch in the Arduino IDE to read the sensor data and calculate the 
distance using the NewPing library. 
• Use the library to convert the sensor data into a distance value and display 
the output on the serial monitor or send it to a remote server for storage and 
processing. 
• Upload the sketch to the Arduino to get the distance measurements. 
 
Here's an example code that demonstrates this process: 

PROGRAM:

#include <NewPing.h> 
#define TRIGGER_PIN  12 
#define ECHO_PIN     11 
#define MAX_DISTANCE 200 
NewPing sonar(TRIGGER_PIN, ECHO_PIN, MAX_DISTANCE); 
void setup() { 
  Serial.begin(9600); 
} 
void loop() { 
  delay(50); 
  int distance = sonar.ping_cm(); 
  Serial.print("Distance: "); 
  Serial.print(distance); 
  Serial.println(" cm"); 
} 
This code uses the NewPing library to calculate the distance using the sensor 
connected to digital pins 12 and 11. The distance is displayed on the serial monitor 
and updated every 50 milliseconds.

OUTPUT:

Distance : 50 cm
Distance : 49 cm
Distance : 51 cm
Distance : 50 cm

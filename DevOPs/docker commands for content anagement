 AIM: Explore Docker commands for content management
DESCRIPTION:Docker is a containerization technology that is widely used for managing application containers.
Here are some commonly used Docker commands forcontent management:
Docker run: Run a command in a new container
 For example: $ docker run --name mycontainer -it ubuntu:16.04 /bin/bash
 This command runs a new container based on the Ubuntu 16 04 image and starts a shell session in the container
Docker start: Start one or more stopped containers
 For example: $ docker start mycontainerThis command starts the container named "mycontainer"
Docker stop: Stop one or more running containers
 For example: $ docker stop mycontainerThis command stops the container named "mycontainer"
Docker rm: Remove one or more containers
 For example: $ docker rm mycontainerThis command removes the container named "mycontainer"

Docker ps: List containers. 
For example: $ docker psThis command lists all running containers.

Docker images: List images. For example: $ docker imagesThis command lists all images stored locally on the host.

Docker pull: Pull an image or a repository from a registry. For example: $ docker pull ubuntu:16.04This command pulls the Ubuntu 16.04 image from the Docker Hub registry.

Docker push: Push an image or a repository to a registry. For example: $ docker push myimageThis command pushes the image named "myimage" to the Docker Hub registry.

These are some of the basic Docker commands for managing containers and images. There are many other Docker commands and options that you can use for more advanced use cases, such as managing networks, volumes, and configuration. However, these commands should give you a good starting point for using Docker for content management.

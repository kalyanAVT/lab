 
Aim: Write a program in prolog to solve Monkey banana problem. 
DESCRIPTION: 
 
• This program defines the rules for the Monkey Banana problem. The 
on/2 predicate takes two arguments and represents the relationship 
between the first argument and the second argument, where the first 
argument is on top of the second argument. 
• The grasp/2 predicate takes two arguments, monkey and banana, and 
represents that the monkey is able to grasp the banana. This predicate 
is defined to be true if the monkey is on the floor and the banana is on 
the floor. 
• The climb/2 predicate takes two arguments, monkey and banana, and 
represents that the monkey is able to climb to the banana. This 
predicate is defined to be true if the monkey is able to grasp the 
banana. 
• Finally, the query ?- climb(monkey, banana) is used to find the 
solution for the Monkey Banana problem, which should return true. 
 
PROGRAM: 
 

on(floor, banana). 
on(monkey, floor). 
grasp(monkey, banana) :- on(monkey, floor), on(floor, banana). 
climb(monkey, banana) :- grasp(monkey, banana). 
 
?- climb(monkey, banana). 
 
% Output 
true.

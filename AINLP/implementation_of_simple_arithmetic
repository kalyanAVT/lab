Aim: Write a program in prolog to implement simple arithmetic. 

DESCRIPTION: 
 
• This program defines rules for performing addition, subtraction, and 
multiplication in Prolog. The add/3 predicate takes three arguments 
X, Y, and Z, and represents the addition of X and Y resulting in Z. 
The sub/3 predicate takes three arguments X, Y, and Z, and 
represents the subtraction of Y from X resulting in Z. The mult/3 
predicate takes three arguments X, Y, and Z, and represents the 
multiplication of X and Y resulting in Z. 
• The s/1 predicate represents the successor of a number in Peano 
arithmetic, which is a system of representing natural numbers using 
only a zero value and the successor function. 
• Finally, the query ?- add(s(s(s(0))), s(s(s(s(0)))), X) is used to find the 
result of 3 + 4, which should return s(s(s(s(s(0))))) as the answer. 
 
PROGRAM: 

add(0, X, X). 
add(s(X), Y, s(Z)) :- add(X, Y, Z). 

sub(X, 0, X). 
sub(X, s(Y), Z) :- sub(X, Y, s(Z)). 
 

mult(0, _, 0). 
mult(s(X), Y, Z) :- mult(X, Y, W), add(W, Y, Z). 
 

?- add(s(s(s(0))), s(s(s(s(0)))), X).

% Output 
X = s(s(s(s(s(0))))).

Aim: Write a program in prolog to implement simple facts and Queries 
 
DESCRIPTION: 

• Prolog (Programming in Logic) is a declarative programming 
language that is based on formal logic.  
• It is used for tasks such as natural language processing, database 
management, and expert systems.  
• In Prolog, you define a set of rules and facts, and then use queries to 
ask the system about relationships between these rules and facts.  
• Prolog uses a form of resolution theorem proving to deduce 
information and provide answers to queries. 

FACTS & QUERIES IN PROLOG: 

Facts in Prolog are represented as predicate/arity statements, where the 
predicate is the name of the relationship and the arity is the number of 
arguments the relationship takes. 
For example,  
parent(john, jim). 
Queries in Prolog are expressed as goals, and are used to ask the system 
about relationships between facts and rules. 
For example,  
?- parent(john, jim). 
 
PROGRAM: 

parent(john, jim). 
parent(jane, jim). 
parent(jim, anna). 
parent(jim, tom). 
parent(tom, lisa). 
 

grandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), parent(Z, Y). 
 

 
% Query to find the grandparent of Lisa 
?- grandparent(X, lisa). 
 
% Output 
X = jim.
